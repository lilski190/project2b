    "background": "The project was developed during the summer semester of 2025 as part of a study module at the Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences. The idea was based on an analysis of real club websites in the Brandenburg region and developed with a user-centered approach.",
    "idea": "Many clubs in Germany operate almost entirely on a volunteer basis. Time, money, and technical know-how are often limited – especially when it comes to website or social media content. As a result, valuable club work often goes unnoticed – even though it plays a central role in social, cultural, and community life. Projektname addresses this challenge by helping clubs quickly and easily create consistent content for multiple channels – whether it’s a new event post or an infographic about their work.",
    "features": "The tool offers: a custom club style guide (colors, logos, fonts), reusable templates for posts, centralized text and image management, and export options for various formats – directly in the browser.",
    "disclaimer": "This project is a scientific prototype. It is currently in development and being evaluated as part of this context. The platform is continuously evolving – feedback is welcome!"
